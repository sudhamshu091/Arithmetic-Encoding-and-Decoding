# Arithmetic-Encoding-and-Decoding
The encoding and decoding algorithms perform arithmetic operations on the code string. One recursion of the algorithm handles one data symbol. Arithmetic coding is actually a family of codes which share the property of treating the code string as a magnitude. I am trying to implement the algorithm using python.
